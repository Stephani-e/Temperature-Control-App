# Temperature-Control-App
This is a simple React-based temperature controller application. It allows users to increase or decrease a numeric temperature value and visually reflects whether the temperature is considered "hot" or "cold" based on a defined threshold. The app uses React's useState hook for state management and conditional class styling for temperature color.
